Package for auto setting GOMAXPROCS based on ECS task and container CPU limits.



Due to Go not being CFS aware ðŸ¥² https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33803 and because [uber automaxprocs](https://github.com/uber-go/automaxprocs) is unable to set GOMAXPROCS for ECS https://github.com/uber-go/automaxprocs/issues/66. This lead to **gomaxecs** a package that auto sets GOMAXPROCS to the ECS Container Limit.

## Installation

`go get -u github.com/rdforte/gomaxecs`

## Quick Start

```go
import _ "github.com/rdforte/gomaxecs"

func main() {
  // Your application logic here.
}
```

## Intro to GOMAXPROCS

GOMAXPROCS is an env variable and function from the [runtime package](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime@go1.23.1) that limits the number of operating system threads that can execute user-level Go code simultaneously. If GOMAXPROCS is not set then it will default to [runtime.NumCPU](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime@go1.23.1#NumCPU) which is the number of logical CPU cores available by the current process. For example if I decide to run my Go application on my shiny new 8 core Mac Pro, then GOMAXPROCS will default to 8. We are able to configure the number of system threads our Go application can execute by using the runtime.GOMAXPROCS function to override this default.

## What is CFS

CFS was introduced to the Linux kernel in version [2.6.23](https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_23) and is the default process scheduler used in Linux. The main purpose behind CFS is to help ensure that each process gets its own fair share of the CPU proportional to its priority. In Docker every container has access to all the hosts resources, within the limits of the kernel scheduler. Though Docker also provides the means to limit these resources through the modifying the containers cgroup on the host machine.

## Performance implications of running Go in Docker

Lets imagine a scenario where we configure our ECS Task to use 8 CPU's and our container to use 4 vCPU's.

```
{
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "cpu": 4096, // Limit container to 4 vCPU's
        }
    ],
    "cpu": "8192", // Task uses 8 CPU's
    "memory": "16384",
    "runtimePlatform": {
        "cpuArchitecture": "X86_64",
        "operatingSystemFamily": "LINUX"
    },
}
```

The ECS Task CPU period is locked into 100ms 

[https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/blob/d68e729f73e588982dc2189a1c618c18c47c931b/agent/api/task/task_linux.go#L39](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent/blob/d68e729f73e588982dc2189a1c618c18c47c931b/agent/api/task/task_linux.go#L39)

The CPU Period refers to the time period in microseconds, where the kernel will do some calculations to figure out the alloted amount of CPU time to provide each task.
In the above configuration this would be 4 vCPU's multiplied by 100ms giving the task 400ms (4 x 100ms).

If all is well and good with our Go application then we would have go routines scheduled on 4 threads.
